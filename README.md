# Sensation-Development
The development github for Sensation - Steamy hot pile of garbage code given to the world by the skid himself - spec

Everyone already skidded my source code so I thought I'd make it public like Eris.

This is simply to keep track of anything I've done.

Feel free to use any existing code in here for your modules
as alot of it still bypasses most modern mc servers...
AS LONG AS YOU GIVE ME CREDIT in the form
of a main menu gui, chat message with my alias upon toggling of any module containing my code.

If you wish to use the event bus within this client, please fork/obtain it from LWJEB by Hippo,
the event bus in here is *not* mine *nor* AnthonyJ's.

If you wish to use the ingame GUI, module manager, or inventory cleaner, find a way to contact AnthonyJ
and request his permission to use it, and let me know his contact info too I'm sure he's dissapeared.

Upon request I can bring up screenshots of him giving me perms to use ethereals base to
form sensation as almost all the ethereal modules where made by me.

If hippo wants me to remove his event bus from this repo I can do this as well.
